We study the effect of managerial practices in health care, focusing on the impact of monetary incentives on physicians’ behavior, in the context of medical scientific research. The scope is to understand whether financial stimula are able to boost the research activity of physicians, by increasing scientific publications and, possibly, their relevance, quality, and impact. We exploit a policy introduced by an Italian healthcare provider, a paramount private-run general hospital in Rome, as well as the seat of the department of medicine and surgery of a major Italian private university. The policy, ushered in 2017, involves a bonus payment for non-academic physicians publishing scientific articles in medical topics, whereas doctors employed by the university affiliated to the hospital are exempted by such bonus. We make use of web-scraped data about all the physicians employed in the hospital under subject, including those who are associated to the linked university, as well as the information on their scientific publications. We implement a Difference-in-Differences econometric design, by including in the treatment group the non-academic physicians subject to the policy, while considering the university doctors part of the controlled units. The aim of the study is not only to estimate whether and the extent to which publications vary due to the economic incentive to physicians, but to explore the available information to understand: 1) whether different types of physicians, according to their age, tenure, expertise and income react diversely to the scheme; 2) whether the publication outcomes have a real impact on the scientific reputation of the hospital/university, by assessing the impact factor of the journal where they are published and the subsequent number of citations; 3) whether there can be disentangled co-authorship networks, spillovers or even free-riding behaviors in response to the policy; 4) whether the policy influences the physicians' career progression.
