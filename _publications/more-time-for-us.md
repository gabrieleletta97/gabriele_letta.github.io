We investigate the effect of an Italian non-pharmaceutical policy aimed at counteracting the spread of Covid-19 on the fertility patterns of Italian women, with a focus on abortions (VPTs). In March 2020, the government forbade the performance of a set of “non-essential” activities; hence, we exploit the variability in the share of suspended workers across Italian municipalities to assess the impact of closures on abortion rates (AR), and pregnancy rates turning into live births 9 months later, by means of a quasi-experimental strategy. Relying on outstanding administrative data on VPTs and births, we find that, the overall drops in abortions due to social distancing notwithstanding, municipalities in the fourth quartile of the suspended workers’ share distribution saw a positive effect on quarterly ARs by a value between 10-13% the average rate before the pandemic, compared to those belonging to lower sections of the distribution. Such difference is driven by industrial suspensions. A non-significant effect is retrieved on births. We make use of relevant socio-economic characteristics to inquire about the channels through which the effect might loom: 1) a reproductive health-related reason, due to a relative shift in unwanted pregnancies given more time available at home for couples; 2) to parity of pregnancies, the socioeconomic insecurity triggered by the policy, added up to the bleak pandemic situation. Whereas the relevant mechanism seems to be the former, the analysis makes room for the fact that the unstable economic environment might have played some role; for the first time with respect to the literature using the same data, we exploit information on past reproductive behavior of the aborting women to shed light on the phenomenon. The effect on abortions is driven both by women who are married and not in professional condition. Plus, and more interestingly, by those who previously had children or abortions. By contrast, the occupational sector of the aborting women is independent on the sector of job suspension. The work may contribute to the knowledge about Italian birth control practices and fertility responsiveness to reproductive care-unrelated public policies.
