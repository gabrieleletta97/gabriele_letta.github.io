We investigate the effect of an Italian non-pharmaceutical policy aimed at counteracting the spread of Covid-19 on the fertility patterns of Italian women, with a focus on abortions (VPTs). In March 2020, the government forbade a set of “non-essential” activities; hence, we exploit the variability in the share of suspended workers across Italian municipalities to assess the impact of closures on abortion rates (AR), and pregnancy rates turning into live births 9 months later, by means of a quasi-experimental strategy. Relying on outstanding administrative data on VPTs and births, we find that, the overall drops in abortions due to social distancing notwithstanding, municipalities in the fourth quartile of the suspended workers’ distribution saw a positive effect on quarterly ARs (between 10-13% the average pre-pandemic rate), compared to those belonging to the lower tail. A non-significant effect is retrieved on births. We employ socio-economic information to inquire about potential mechanisms: 1) a reproductive health reason, i.e. a relative shift in unwanted pregnancies given more couples' time availability; 2) to parity of pregnancies, the socioeconomic insecurity triggered by the policy. Whereas the relevant channel seems to be the former, the unstable economic environment might have played some role; plus, for the first time in the research with the same data, we exploit information on past reproductive behavior of the aborting women. The effect on abortions is driven both by women who are married and not in professional condition. Plus, and more interestingly, by those who previously had children or abortions. By contrast, the occupational sector of the aborting women is independent on the sector of job suspension, while the industrial sector-driven effect linked to married women hints that, for the aborting women, their male partners' work trajectories matter more than theirs in the context of such decision-making process.
